Organism Simulator 2014
===================

This program generates organisms with 31 genes, each of which is an integer from 0 to 10. Organisms then proceed to play Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLK) against each other, round-robin style. An organism's probability distribution for different RPSLK throws is a function of its genes. Whichever organism "wins" the exchange gains points, the amount of which being a function of its genes as well. After the organisms have played out this competition, the ones who won more points get to reproduce more copies of themselves (with genes slightly altered) whereas organisms who didn't do as well get killed with no "children". After thousands of generations, patterns can be observed in the graphs of population data.
